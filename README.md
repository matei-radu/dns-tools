# DNS Tools
A collection of DNS tools and libraries written in Rust from scratch.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is twofold:

1. Challenge myself by developing a long-term, complex project.
2. Improve my Rust proficiency.

## Contributing
Since this is a personal learning project, external contributions are not accepted.

This may change in the future if the project matures and becomes genuinely useful.
